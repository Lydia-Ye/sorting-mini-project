- Chatgpt (I asked it for a brief draft of Tim sort implementation using java, which I didn't really used in my own version, but it helps me better understand the Tim sort algorithm. I also asked chatgpt to help me debug when I encountered a problem with setting the range of each run in YeLydia sort. It failed to fix that problem but it kind of gave me a hint which helped me figured out that problem at the end. )
